This project corresponds to the first assignment of the Randomized Algorithms course from the MIRI master's program at UPC.

The usage instructions are as follows:
- First, compile the program using the command `make all`.
- Then, execute the program with `./galtonBoard n_bins n_balls`.
- The output of the simulation will be saved in the folder `Simulations` with the filename `simulation_{n_bins}_{n_balls}.csv`.

Execute the programm with no arguments to see the Usage function.
